# CTA Cheat Sheet

## Objective of this document
The goal of this document is to group key information that are needed to pass the salesforce CTA exam. Don't expect to see technical things in this documents but more **Best Practices** and **Limitations** to take into consideration when solving the scenario.

There will be no discussion about Software Architecture as CTA and Software architecture are 2 different things and often developer have difficulties to distinguish between both concepts.
