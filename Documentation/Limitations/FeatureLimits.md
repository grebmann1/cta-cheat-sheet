# Limitations - Feature Limits

## Sales Cloud
### Web to Lead 
With Web-to-Lead, you can capture up to `500 leads in a 24-hour period`. This operates similarly to the Web-to-Case queue.

## Service Cloud
### Web to Case

With Web-to-Case, you can capture up to `5,000 cases in a 24-hour period`. If the number exceeds this limit, the pending requests are added to a queue that can contain a maximum of 50,000 requests (Web-to-Case and Web-to-Lead combined).

## Platform

### Custom Notification
#### Overview
- Up to **500 custom notification types** per organization.
- A maximum of **10,000 users** as recipients for each notification after expanding groups, queues, or teams. 
- Up to **10,000 notification actions** can be executed per hour. Any unsent notifications after the limit are lost and resume in the next hour.
#### Viewing Notifications
- **Desktop**: 
  - Users can view notifications from the last **30 days**, with 50 notifications displayed at a time in the tray. Maximum tray size: **10,000 notifications**. Exceeding 7,500 triggers a purge to 5,000 notifications.
  
- **Salesforce Mobile App**: 
  - Users can view up to **20 notifications** at a time, with older notifications accessible via swiping. Notifications older than 30 days are deleted.
  
- **Purge Mechanism**: If the number of notifications exceeds 10,000, the user wonâ€™t receive new notifications. A purge job runs daily to maintain 5,000 notifications.

#### Handling Delivery Channels
- **Pausing Delivery**: Disabling a delivery channel (mobile, desktop) halts visibility, but notifications are still created. When re-enabled, stored notifications become visible.
  
- **Mobile Notifications**: 
  - **In-app notifications** require the **Enable in-app notifications setting**. 
  - Push notifications for the Salesforce mobile app require the **Enable push notifications setting**.

Visualforce email templates can't be used for "Mass Emailing".
