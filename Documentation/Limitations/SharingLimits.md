# Limitations - Sharing Limits

There are two types of sharing rules limits per entity (per object). They are as follows:
A general sharing rules limit that counts for all sharing rules, including criteria-based. The default limit is 300 and can be increased to a maximum of 500 through a Support case.
Separate criteria-based sharing rules limit. The default limit is 50 and can be increased to a maximum of 200 through a Support case.

| Type | Limits | Comments
|--|--|--|
| Sharing Rules (General) | `300` | Can be increased to 1k
| Sharing Rules (Criteria Based) | `50` | Can be increased to 200

Note: Too many sharing rules can slow down inserts and updates. As a best practice, please review the organization's sharing rules to determine if an increase is necessary.
