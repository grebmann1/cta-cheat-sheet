# Limitations - Sharing Limits

There are two types of sharing rules limits per entity (per object). They are as follows:

1. A general sharing rules limit that counts for all sharing rules, including criteria-based. The default limit is 300 and can be increased to a maximum of 500 through a Support case.

2. Separate criteria-based sharing rules limit. The default limit is 50 and can be increased to a maximum of 200 through a Support case.

| Type | Limits | Comments |
|------|--------|----------|
| Sharing Rules (Criteria & Owner based) | `300` | Can be increased to 1,000 |
| Sharing Rules (Criteria based) | `50` | Can be increased to 200 |
| Restriction Rules | `5 per Object` | This restricts the records available to the user (Doesn't work with standard objects) |

Note: Too many sharing rules can slow down inserts and updates. It's recommended to review the organization's sharing rules to determine if an increase is necessary.
