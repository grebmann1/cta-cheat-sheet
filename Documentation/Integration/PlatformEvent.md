# Integration - Platform Event

### When to Use Platform Event?

1. Real-Time Integration
2. Update External/Internal System with Specific Information/Event
3. Execute Async Flow/Apex with Internal Subscriber
4. Monitor Execution and/or Issues

### How to Publish Platform Event?

1. Flows
2. Processes
3. Apex
4. Salesforce APIs (REST, SOAP, Pub/Sub)

### Data Life

Events are stored in the event bus for `3 days (72h)` for high-volume events. Each event contains a "ReplayId" field that can be used to retrieve the event.
Standard events are now deprecated (Only available for API < 44.0)

### Security

Before delivering a platform event message to a subscribed client, the event payload is decrypted using the encryption key. The platform event message is sent over a secure channel using HTTPS and TLS, ensuring data protection and encryption while in transit.
(Classic Encryption isn't supported; Shield Platform Encryption needs to be enabled)

#### Delivery vs. Publishing

Non-API clients (Apex triggers, Process Builder processes, and flows) donâ€™t count against the event **delivery limit** but toward the **publishing limit**.
