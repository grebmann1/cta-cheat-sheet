## Data Actions in Data Cloud

Send an alert or an event to a target based on streaming insights and engagement data to trigger an automation or data integration. `The supported targets are Salesforce Platform Event, Webhook, and Marketing Cloud`.

A data action containing a rich payload can be triggered based on certain conditions and can enable downstream systems to drive an action or orchestration.

You can use a data action to focus on near real-time events and insights at different levels, for example, at the channel, product, account, service, sell, fulfillment, engagement, payment, and individual level.

A data action can enable different types of event-driven integrations and orchestrations.

- `Orchestrate Salesforce CRM workflows` with insights and data events from Data Cloud.
- `Integrate data actions in Mulesoft Anypoint` by sharing aggregated event data with external partners based on criteria.
- Integrate with SaaS applications with signals from Data Cloud.
- `Trigger serverless functions that work with a webhook` based on insights in Data Cloud.
