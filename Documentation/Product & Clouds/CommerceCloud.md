# Commerce Cloud

Commerce Cloud addresses B2C and B2B business cases and provides a digital storefront for online sales.

## Licenses
Salesforce Commerce Cloud pricing is based on "Income" (No User license). This license type applies to both B2C and B2B solutions.

The licensing model is based on permission set licenses. When a permission set is assigned to the user, the permission set license is consumed.

### External Users Licenses
For buyer users, a Customer Community license grants minimum access to use B2B Commerce features. Buyer managers or buyers requiring access to other buyers, role-based sharing, reports, and objects beyond B2B Commerce objects need a Customer Community Plus or higher license.
