# Salesforce Order Management
Salesforce Order Management is an add-on to provide advanced order management capabilities to Salesforce. 

With the Order Management app:

- `Customers can submit orders from any commerce channel`, and then track and manage their orders throughout the order lifecycle.
- Merchants can manage order fulfillment, shipping, payment capture, invoicing, and service by using integrated and customizable business processes and workflows.
- Service agents can access a master repository of all order-related information, see a global view of the entire order lifecycle, and `process cancellations, returns, exchanges, reshipments, refunds, and discounts`.

## Licenses
Salesforce Order Management is provided via a global license based on the "Income". (No User license)
