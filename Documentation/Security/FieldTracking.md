# Field Tracking

Field Tracking is a standard functionality that allows the administrator to `track up to 20 fields per object` in Salesforce.

Data is accessible for up to 18 months from the UI and 24 months from the API. If needed for a longer period, it's recommended to archive them.

**Important:** Field history tracking data and Field Audit Trail data do not count against your data storage limits.

## Field Audit Trail

An Add-on [Field Audit Trail](../Product%20&%20Clouds/addOn_ShieldAuditTrail.md) can be purchased to extend the functionality of the OTB **Field Tracking** capabilities such as :
- `track up to 60 fields per object`
- Define Field History Rentention policies
- Archive Filed History in Big Objects
