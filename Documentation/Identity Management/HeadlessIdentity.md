# Salesforce Headless Identity

Salesforce Headless Identity refers to a method of managing identity and access in Salesforce applications where authentication is handled on the client side, external to any Salesforce-provided user interface. This approach is crucial in custom applications or third-party integrations where the user experience is defined outside of Salesforce's standard UI but still requires access to Salesforce's backend services.

`Headless Identity is distinguished from standard Salesforce authentication` by its focus on enabling authentication through custom or third-party UIs, rather than Salesforce's default login mechanisms.

## Client-Side Authentication Flow

The cornerstone of Salesforce Headless Identity is implementing a client-side authentication flow, often leveraging OAuth 2.0 protocols.

### Custom UI Integration

The authentication process is integrated into a `custom-built user interface, independent of Salesforce's UI`. This allows for a seamless user experience tailored to specific business needs or branding requirements.

Users interact with this custom interface for authentication, and the interface then communicates with Salesforce in the background. `The authentication information is handled by the client-side application` and is used to request access tokens from Salesforce.

### OAuth 2.0 User Agent Flow

A common approach for Headless Identity is using the `OAuth 2.0 User Agent Flow`. In this flow:

1. The user logs in through the custom interface.
2. The client-side application sends the user's credentials to Salesforce.
3. Salesforce validates the credentials and returns an access token.
4. `The client-side application uses this token to access Salesforce APIs` on behalf of the user.

This flow ensures that the user's interaction remains within the custom UI, while Salesforce handles the authentication in the background.

## Considerations and Best Practices

- **Security**: Ensure the security of the client-side application, particularly in handling user credentials and access tokens.
- **User Experience**: Design the custom UI to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.
- **Compliance with Salesforce Limits**: Be aware of and comply with Salesforce's API request limits and other usage constraints.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage authentication failures or interruptions.

In summary, Salesforce Headless Identity allows for the integration of Salesforce authentication into custom or third-party client-side applications, providing a tailored user experience while leveraging Salesforce's robust backend capabilities.
