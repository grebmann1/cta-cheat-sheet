# Customer Identity

Salesforce Customer Identity is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) service designed to enhance engagement with customers and partners. It enables the creation of customized sites tailored to your brand's needs, providing tools to customize user logins, registrations, identity verification, and single sign-on access to web pages and applications.

`Customer Identity is similar to Salesforce Identity for Employees` but emphasizes how customers and partners connect to your organization, enhancing their brand experience.


## Passwordless Login

Configure passwordless login to simplify login and registration processes for users. This feature allows users to log in, sign up, and verify identity methods without the need to remember usernames or passwords.

### Email or Phone Number Registration

Enable passwordless login for self-registration by allowing `users to register with an email address or phone number`, eliminating the need to create and remember a separate username and password. During self-registration, users are prompted to enter their email address or phone number. `Salesforce sends a verification code to the user via the specified method`.

Once users input the verification code in Salesforce, they can log in using their email address or phone number. `For subsequent logins, Salesforce sends them a verification code instead of requiring a password`.

### Verification Method Registration

Offer users more control by allowing them to register and deregister various verification methods, including:
- Email
- SMS
- Time-based one-time password (TOTP)
- Physical U2F security key
- Salesforce Authenticator

Once users register a verification method, they can utilize it for login purposes. For instance, instead of logging in with a password, a user can authenticate using a TOTP generated by an authenticator app.
